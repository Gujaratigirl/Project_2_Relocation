## State to State Migration Page

Welcome to the 2019 United States State-to-State Migration dashboard!
This page uses American Community Survey data from the latest available year, 2019, to visualize recent state-to-state migration trends for 5 U.S. states of interest:   


           Indiana.  
           California.  
           Florida.  
           North Carolina.  
           Texas.  

Four of the five states were chosen for having the highest overall migration totals, and the fifth state, Indiana, is of interest for being the residence of the majority of the 2021 Butler University data analytics cohort.   

Choose your state of interest from the drop-down to see inflows and outflows. Select the “Inflow” to see where recent migrants to your chosen state moved from; select the “Outflow” button to see where individuals who recently left your chosen state moved to. The map will refresh to show the values as a heat map.
